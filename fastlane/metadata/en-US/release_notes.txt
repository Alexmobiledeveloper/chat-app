This is a bug fix update for 3.6 that prevents a few login crashes. Sorry about that! 3.6 update notes follow:

Messages consisting entirely of emoji are now enlarged so you can enjoy their glorious detail. Of course, emoji-haters can turn this off in settings.

We're also now treating images uploaded through the app as first class citizens. Thumbnails are now shown in push notifications and embedded in your message history.

Other new features and fixes:

• Added dialogs for changing your password and deleting your account
• Added support for /whowas
• Added support for /links
• Tapping an archived channel will now automatically load a page of backlog
• Improved collapsing of quits and joins during a netsplit
• Fixed the "Load More Backlog" button appearing in new or empty channels
• Stability improvements, and minor fixes
